  - `#08c`

## Fill Color

The hexadecimal color value of the "body" or "area" of points and polygons on the map (the area inside the lines, not including the lines themselves). Also used as a default color for the record in other contexts. For example, if the record has date information, the fill color is used to render the plotting that represents the record on the timeline.
