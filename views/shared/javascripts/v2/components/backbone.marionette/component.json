It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build\nsmall apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that\nsupport mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is\nnot a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves\nmuch of the application design, architecture and scalability to the \ndeveloper, including memory management, view management, and more.\n\nMarionette brings an application architecture to Backbone, along with\nbuilt in view management and memory management. It's designed to be a \nlightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone, \nproviding a framework for building scalable application.\n\nLike Backbone itself, you're not required to use all of Marionette just \nbecause you want to use some of it. You can pick and choose which features \nyou want to use, when. This allows you to work with other Backbone \nframeworks and plugins very easily. It also means that you are not required\nto engage in an all-or-nothing migration to begin using Marionette.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n* Scale applications out with modular, event driven architecture\n* Sensible defaults, such as using Underscore templates for view rendering\n* Easy to modify to make it work with your applicaton's specific needs\n* Reduce boilerplate for views, with specialized view types\n* Build on a modular architecture with an `Application` and modules that attach to it\n* Compose your application's visuals at runtime, with `Region` and `Layout`\n* Nested views and layouts within visual regions\n* Built-in memory management and zombie killing in views, regions and layouts\n* Built-in event clean up with the `EventBinder`\n* Event-driven architecture with the `EventAggregator`\n* Flexible, \"as-needed\" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need\n* And much, much more\n\n## Compatibility And Requirements\n\nBackbone.Marionette currently works with the following versions of these \nlibraries:\n\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) v1.8.2\n* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) v1.4.1\n* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) v0.9.2\n* [Backbone.EventBinder](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.eventbinder) v0.1.0\n* [Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr) v0.0.0\n\nMarionette has not been tested against any other versions of these\nlibraries. You may or may not have success if you use a version other\nthan what it listed here.\n\nWhile support for Zepto and Enderjs has been added, it is not officially\ntested against these libraries at this time.\n\nMarionette makes use of jQuery's [Deferred](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)\nobjects and, as such, will need supported methods in replacement libraries.\nZepto users can use @Mumakil's [Standalone-Deferred](https://github.com/Mumakil/Standalone-Deferred)\nor @sudhirj's [simply-deferred](https://github.com/sudhirj/simply-deferred).\nEnderjs users, please let us know of how you solve any compatibility issues.\n\n## Source Code And Downloads\n\nYou can download the latest builds directly from the \"lib\" folder above.  \nFor more information about the files in this folder, or to obtain an archive\ncontaining all Marionette dependencies (including Underscore, Backbone, etc),\nplease see [the downloads section on the website](http://marionettejs.com#downloads).\n\n#### [http://marionettejs.com#downloads](http://marionettejs.com#downloads)\n\n### Marionette.Async Add-on\n\nMarionette.Async has officially been removed from the core Marionette\nrepository. See the [Marionette.Async repository](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette.async)\nfor downloads, documentation, and more information.\n\n### Available Packages\n\nMarionette is unofficially available from various package\nmanagement systems, such as RubyGems, Node Package Manager,\nNuget, etc. These packages are maintained by the community\nand are not part of the core Backbone.Marionette code.\n\n##### [Available Packages](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki/Available-packages)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation is split up in to multiple files, due to the size\nof the over-all documentation.
